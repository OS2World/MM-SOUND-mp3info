MP3info - An MP3 technical info viewer and ID3 1.x tag editor


ABOUT
=====

Q: What's MP3Info?

A: MP3Info is a little utility used to read and modify the ID3 tags of MP3
files. MP3Info can also display various techincal aspects of an MP3 file
including playing time, bit-rate, sampling frequency and other attributes
in a pre-defined or user-specifiable output format.

Q: OK, so what's an 'MP3'?

A:  MP3 (MPEG layer 3) is a very popular digital audio format which encodes
a recording with a lossy compression algorithm resulting in files representing
a minute of near-CD quality stereo sound in less than a megabyte of data.
Compare this to non-compressed formats (Windows .WAV files for instance)
which encode the same minute of audio in about ten megabytes of data.  MP3
is the audio format exchanged on Napster networks and its clones.

Q: What's an 'ID3 tag'?

A: An ID3 tag is a little scrap of data added to the end of the MP3 file
which stores information about the audio recording including the title,
artist, album, copyright date, and musical genre.  ID3 tags are an optional
feature of the MP3 format, so not all MP3 files have ID3 tags.


HISTORY
=======

MP3Info was originally written by Ricardo Cerqueira <rmc@rccn.net>.  As of
January 2000, MP3Info is being maintained by Cedric Tefft
<cedric@earthling.net>.

PORTABILITY
===========

MP3Info was developed under Linux, but should work on most UN*X variants.
Included with the text-based version is a gui version which requires the GTK
libraries (see http://www.gtk.org).  The console version runs in plain
command-line and interactive curses mode.  The curses or ncurses library is
required.


OBTAINING THE LATEST VERSION OF MP3INFO
=======================================

MP3Info's home is the public library archive at ibiblio.org
(formerly MetaLab, formerly SunSite). Both source and i386 RPM's
are available.

The entire ibiblio Linux archive (including MP3Info) is mirrored to many other
locations around the world.  A full and current list of ibiblio mirrors can be

INSTALLATION
============

See the file 'INSTALL' for build and installation instructions


Help/Usage/HowTo (Console Version)
==================================
MP3Info is fully documented in its manual page.	 To view the manual page,
simply type 'man mp3info' at any time after installation.  If you don't
have groff installed on your system or for some other reason can't read
the man page, a text-only version is available in the file mp3info.txt


Usage: GTK Version
==================

gmp3info song.mp3



MISCELLANEOUS NEWS & INFO
=========================

MP3Info is looking for a new name!  Several people have pointed out that there
are other, older programs out there called mp3info which arguably have more of
a "right" (in as much as such a thing exists in the open source world) to the
name than this program.	 Name suggestions, like bug reports, are happily
accepted.


DISCLAIMER
==========

I do not take responsibility for damaged files, MP3s or not. If you decide to
run this on something other than an MP3, tough luck. You're on your own.

BUGS
====

Known bugs and limitations are detailed in the manual page.  If you have any
bug reports or patches, please email them to me.  Bugs get fixed a lot faster
if you include patches -- especially if the problem is platform specific.


TO DO
=====

Add support for ID3v2 3.0 (www.id3.org) if it starts to become more widely used.
Currently only ID3 v1.0 and 1.1 are supported.

Add an "Open file" option to GMP3info.

Add technical info display (-x in the command-line version) to the GTK version.

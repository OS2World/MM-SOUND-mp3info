v0.8.2	- Fixed a bug which caused mp3info to erroneously report some
	  constant bitrate (CBR) files as variable bitrate (VBR) files.

v0.8.1	- Fixed an elusive bug that sometimes caused mp3info to fail to
	  find an ID3 tag even when one was present.

v0.8	- Added the ability to handle VBR (Variable Bit Rate) MP3 files
	- Added the ability to deal with garbage or non-standard headers
	  at the beginning of a file
	- Added user-specifiable output format with capabilities similar
	  to printf(3)
	- The GTK version now handles read-only files correctly
	- Techincal Info display (-x) greatly improved and is now
	  considered reliable.
	- UNIX man page created for mp3info (console version only)
	- Major internal code re-engineering

v0.7	- Added extended genres (taken from WinAmp).
	- Fixed minor bug in genre list display
	- Fixed a bug in the GTK version which set the genre to 'Blues' if
	  the MP3 file did not have an existing ID3 tag.
	- Help screen and documentation fixed up and edited for clarity.
	- Added -f switch to force MP3Info to process files as if they were
	  MP3's even if they don't contain the standard MP3 header.
	- Added support for ID3 v1.1 tags (track numbers) - Thanks to Don
	  Melton (don@blivet.com)
	- Added an option (-x) to display technical information about the
	  MP3 file.  This is an experimental feature and should not be
	  considered reliable.

v0.6.1	- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.6 that set genre to 'Blues' if no genre
	  was given on the command line and the MP3 file did not have an
	  existing ID3 tag.

v0.6	- As of this version maintenance of mp3info has been taken over
	  by Cedric Tefft <cedric@earthling.net>
	- Reworked command-line/curses version to handle processing multiple MP3's.
	- Added the capability to delete an existing ID3 tag (-d switch)
	- Added full text/numeric genre handling to command-line, curses and GTK modes.
	- Added the capability to display the list of valid genres (-G switch)
	- View mode is now determined automatically when no other options are specified.
	  The -v option is accepted for backward compatibility, but ignored.  It
	  should probably be removed in a future version.
	- Added ID3 structure to make internal argument passing a little cleaner.
	- Consolidated ID3 tag reading/writing code.
	- Interactive mode now displays existing tags.
	- Modified Makefile to make gmp3info dependant on gmp3info.c

v0.5	- Added genre tag. (Still in numerical form) (Thanks to jsc@arsdigita.com)
	- Corrected a byte ordering bug which affected Sun systems (Thanks to Benjamin Korvemaker)
	- Corrected a permissions bug (Thanks to Carsten Hahn)
	- Fixed a GTK bug in gmp3info. (Thanks go to Thomas Schultz)

v0.4	- gmp3info is now part of the pack.
	  Fixed some incompatibity problems with SGI (thanks again to Petter) and RedHat 6.0.
	- Added MP3 check, using the magic number (Thanks to Steven James for this one)

v0.3.1	- Fixed a couple of HP/UX incompatibilities (Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen)
	- Added -v (to view an existing tag)

v0.3	- Fixed "trash in the fields" bug. (Strings are now forced to be null-terminated)
	  Updated help screen.
	  Fixed minor warnings during compile.
	  If "-h" is among options, others are now ignored.
	  "-i" now must be specified for interactive (curses) mode.
	  Commented and cleaned code.

v0.3-b1 - Added reading and preservation of existing tags in command line mode.
	  Fixed occasional tag seek bug.
	  Changed options parsing to use "getopt"
